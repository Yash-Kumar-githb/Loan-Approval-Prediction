# Loan Approval Prediction

## Project Overview
This project predicts loan approval for applicants using financial and personal details. By analyzing key features like **credit history**, **property area**, and **income**, it automates decision-making to improve speed and accuracy.

## Business Context
- **Problem:** Manual loan approval is slow and error-prone.  
- **Opportunity:** A predictive model can streamline the process, reduce workload, and enhance customer experience.

## Solution Goals
- Predict loan approval (Approved/Rejected) accurately.  
- Speed up and standardize the loan approval process.  
- Assist financial institutions in optimizing resources.

## Stakeholders
- **Loan Officers:** Support or automate decision-making.  
- **Management:** Improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.  
- **Customers:** Benefit from faster and transparent loan decisions.

## Dataset Overview
- **Key Features:** 
  - Credit History (binary)  
  - Property Area (categorical)  
  - Income (numeric)  
- **Target Variable:** Loan Status (1: Approved, 0: Rejected)  
- **Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical features, scale numeric data.

## Technical Solution
- **Models Evaluated:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost  
- **Selection Criteria:** Accuracy, F1-score, and interpretability  
- **Output:** Predictions for individual applicants or bulk datasets

## Expected Outcomes
- Faster and consistent loan approvals  
- Reduced operational costs  
- Early identification of high-risk applicants  
- Data-driven operational improvements
